# SMART-CLASSROOM
The main objective of this project is to develop a Smart Classroom Prototype using an Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
As technology is advancing so schools are also getting smarter. Modern Schools are gradually shifting from conventional switches to centralized control system, involving remote controlled switches. Presently, conventional wall switches located in different
parts of a classroom makes it difficult for the user to go near them to operate. 
In order to achieve this , IR Modules are interfaced to the Arduino Board,which count the number of students present in class and uploads the data to cloud using ESP8266 . The Raspberry Pi recieves the data from the cloud and controls the indivisual light and fan
zones of a classroom.The loads are operated by Raspberry Pi board through Relay. A master switch is also present on Adafruit which can be accessed by the Teacher.
